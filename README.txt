# ARES-TELEMETRY-2020
This project is an Arduino sketch designed for the Nano 33 BLE that takes telemetry data from:
* pressure transducers
* IMU - LSM9DS1
* Barometer - LPS22HB
* HTS - HTS221

and outputs it to:
* SD card
* RFD900 Radio

In 'firmware/', is the actual C++ code that is compiled and deployed to the device

In 'modules/', is the modularized form of the code. Each file ending .module.h is preprocessed with a Kotlin script into
a corresonding file in 'firmware/'.

### IMU on the Arduino NANO 33 BLE Sense

The IMU is a LSM9DS1, it is a 3-axis accelerometer, 3-axis gyroscope and 3-axis magnetometer. This chip, made by ST Microelectronics, is a standard component supported by the ArduinoLSM9DS1 library.


### Pressure on the Arduino NANO 33 BLE Sense

The barometer sensor is a LPS22HB, is an ultra-compact sensor which functions as a digital output barometer. This chip, made by ST is supported by the ArduinoLPS22HB library.

### Relative humidity and temperature on the Arduino NANO 33 BLE Sense

The relative humidity and temperature sensor is a HTS221, is an ultra-compact sensor that uses a polymer dielectric planar capacitor structure capable of detecting relative humidity variations and temperature, returned as digital output on a serial interface. This chip, made by ST is supported by the ArduinoHTS221 library.
